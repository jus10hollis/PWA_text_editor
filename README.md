# Progressive Web Applications (PWA): Text Editor

## Description
This is a text editor that runs in the browser. This single-page application meets PWA standards and stores data to an IndexedDB database. Users can retrieve text and install the application to run it offline.

## Installation
Clone the repository from [https://github.com/jus10hollis/PWA_text_editor]. From the terminal, run `npm install`. Once the terminal is finished installing the dependencies, run `npm start`.
Alternatively, visit the heroku deployed application here: [https://polar-eyrie-69095.herokuapp.com/].

## Issues
We encountered some minor issues with running the dev dependencies. We therefore recommend for users spinning up the application from the command line to run `npm start` rather than `npm run start:dev`.
